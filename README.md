# dataAugmentationMATLAB
MATLAB script for data augmentation. 


This program performs rotation, translation, scaling, reflection or mirroring, shear, and three different synthetic noise forms of data augmentation (salt and pepper, gaussian noise and blur) in a specific folder. It works as is with .jpg files but you can easily modify it. To visualize your original data you can uncomment lines 11 & 12.
